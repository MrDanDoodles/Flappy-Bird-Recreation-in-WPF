# Flappy-Bird-Recreation-in-WPF
This project is a faithful recreation of the iconic game Flappy Bird, developed using C# and the WPF framework. It features the original gameâ€™s visuals and aims to capture the classic gameplay experience. As one of my first major projects with WPF, this endeavor has been a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of the framework while tackling a fun and nostalgic challenge.

Intial Entry:
Initial setup: Added project structure, parallax background, and placeholder ball for the bird.

First Update:
Reworked the Bird class and added them to the main grid to appear on the screen. Reworked the background to also work with the canvas (Where the bird object is a child of).

Second Update:
I cleaned up the code for the MainWindow.xaml.cs by introducing the background class that will take care of creating background objects, assigning layers by reference and setting its layer. I also reworked the bird class to do the same. This allows for the main window file to be less cluttered, much more organized, and legible.
