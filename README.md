# Flappy-Bird-Recreation-in-WPF
This project is a faithful recreation of the iconic game Flappy Bird, developed using C# and the WPF framework. It features the original gameâ€™s visuals and aims to capture the classic gameplay experience. As one of my first major projects with WPF, this endeavor has been a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of the framework while tackling a fun and nostalgic challenge.

First Commit:
Initial setup: Added project structure, parallax background, and placeholder ball for the bird.
