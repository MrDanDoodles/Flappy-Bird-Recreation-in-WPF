# Flappy-Bird-Recreation-in-WPF
A faithful recreation of the classic Flappy Bird, built in C# using the WPF framework and featuring the gameâ€™s original visuals. This project focuses on replicating the gameplay experience while serving as one of my first major endeavors to deepen my skills in WPF development.
